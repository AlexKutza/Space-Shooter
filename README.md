# Space-Shooter
Project 2 for MSCH-C220

In this twist on a space-shooter, you play as a turtle trying to defend her eggs from creatures on the beach. This game features multiple enemies, bullets, art, music, a score, a health system, a timing system, and UI design. There are two different ending screens, where defeating all the enemies will lead to a "win" screen, while running out of lives or time will trigger a "lose" screen.

## Implementation
This game was implemented entirely in Godot 4.

## What Makes this a Game?
The score, health, and time information allows the player to change their strategy during each round and develop competence. These features also allow the player to develop their own goals and play styles, which encourages autonomy. By giving the player a meaningful purpose besides surviving, to protect a nest of eggs, this game can evoke a meaningful sense of relatedness with the turtle character. The two different ending screens show that the players actions and success in the game have an impact on the success of the turtle family.

## Future Development
I would like to implement enemies that move more naturally and predictably, allowing for more strategic gameplay rather than random chaos. The enemies would be able to attack the nest itself, and the player would have to deal with waves of progressively more threatening creatures. This would add a "tower defense" mode of gameplay. It would also be cool if the environment could be more involved in the gameplay, such as if the player had to gather rocks from the beach to replenish "ammo," or if the waves could rise and impact the game state.
